Desktop Keypresses:
A list of Keyboard inputs can be found in: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
E.g. -> Input.GetKey(KeyCode.UpArrow)
Input.GetKey ->	Returns True while the user holds down the key identified by 'name'.
Input.GetKeyDown ->	Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key identified by 'name'.
Input.GetKeyUp ->	Returns true during the frame the user releases the key identified by 'name'.



- transform.Translate(new Vector3(0,0,1) * Time.deltaTime)
	-> This moves an object within the game.
	-> Multiplying the Vector3 by the time value makes the object move in distance per unit time.
	-> Doing this multiplication means this runs a lot better.
	-> Vector3.forward moves the objext in the positive Z-axis (doing this means you can establish the movespeed as a separate value).
