Touch Controls in Unity
***************************
- A touch is tracked over its "lifetime" by the device.
- The start and end of a touch and movements in between can be reported on the frames they occur.


Touch.phase - The action the finger has taken on the most recent frame update.
- This property can be used as the basis of a "switch" statement, or any state handling system basically.
-  See: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Touch-phase.html

Touch.deltaPosition 	- This is a Vector2 that represents the difference between the touch position 
		  recorded on the most recent update and that recorded on the previous update.
The deltaTime value gives the time that elapsed between the previous and current updates.
You can calculate the touch's speed of motion by dividing deltaPosition.magnitude by deltaTime.

Touch.fingerId - The unique index for the touch 

Input.touches - Returns a list of objects representing the status of all touches during last frame.
	- Each entry represents a status of a finger touching the screen.
See here for some code in keeping track of multiple touches: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input-touches.html

TouchPhase - This is an object formed of an enumeration, it describes the phase of a finger touch.
- Began, Moved, Stationary, Ended, Cancelled
Use: if(TouchPhase.Moved == true)
